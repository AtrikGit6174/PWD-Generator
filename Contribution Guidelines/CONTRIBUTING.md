Thank you for choosing to contribute. 
Since this project uses Google Colab, which is an IPython notebook, there are some special requirements needed for contributing so that the project does not break.

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name.
3. Open the Google Colab link. Verify and work on the code.
4. File ->  Save a copy to GitHub. 
    * If GitHub and GColab are not integrated, you may have to work on integrating it. It is a simple OAuth work.
5. Choose the repo and the correct branch. 
    * It is often likely to miss the branch while choosing. (Telling from experience ðŸ˜ƒ)
6. Make sure to âœ… "Include a link to Colaboratory".
    * This will generate a "Open in Colab" button on top of the PWD-Generator.ipynb, which will open the GColab link to the PWD-Generator.ipynb of your branch.
