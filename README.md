# PWD-Generator
A simple Python project to generate passwords based on user constraints.

<ul>
  Enter the number of characters to get started.
  </br>Choose and enter constraints like number of capital letters, small letters, special chars or digits.
  </br>Checks are provided so that (no. of constrained chars <= total no. of chars). Re-entry in case of mistake is allowed.
</ul>
  
Get your required random password.

Plans to expand (not yet available):
1. Based on user requirement, save the passwords in a text file with user-provided label.
2. User can enter a phrase, which can be scrambled and made a part of their password.
