# Welcome to PWD-Generator
A simple Python project to generate passwords based on user constraints.

* Launched at: [https://atrikgit6174.github.io/PWD-Generator](https://atrikgit6174.github.io/PWD-Generator)
* Google Colaboratory: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tVz95eeYWkjIGvxflvlKy_x0f0rWC7dr#scrollTo=-JlL11EItRd8](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tVz95eeYWkjIGvxflvlKy_x0f0rWC7dr#scrollTo=-JlL11EItRd8)

Dated: 28.06.2021

This project is brought to you by **Atrik Ray**.
As of now, I am a CSE undergrad, expected to graduate by 2023.

* Step 1. Enter the number of characters to get started.
* Step 2. Choose and enter constraints like number of capital letters, small letters, special chars or digits.
* Step 3. Checks are provided so that (no. of constrained chars <= total no. of chars). Re-entry in case of mistake is allowed.

Get your required random password.

Plans to expand (not yet available):
1. Based on user requirement, save the passwords in a text file with user-provided label.
2. User can enter a phrase, which can be scrambled and made a part of their password.
