# Welcome to PWD-Generator
A simple Python project to generate passwords based on user constraints.

* Launched at: [https://atrikgit6174.github.io/PWD-Generator](https://atrikgit6174.github.io/PWD-Generator)
* [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AtrikGit6174/PWD-Generator/blob/main/PWD_Generator.ipynb)

This project is brought to you by **[Atrik Ray](https://github.com/AtrikGit6174)**.
As of now, I am a CSE undergrad, expected to graduate by 2023.

* Step 1. (Required) Enter the number of characters to get started.
* Step 2. (Optional) Enter a few characters of your choice (they will be scrambled and used in your password)
	* Checks are provided so that (no. of input chars <= total no. of chars). Re-entry in case of mistake is allowed.
* Step 3. (Optional) Enter no. of constraints like number of capital letters, small letters, special chars or digits.
	* Checks are provided so that (no. of constrained chars <= total no. of chars). Re-entry in case of mistake is allowed.
	
Get your required random password.

* Step 4. (Optional) Enter whether or not to scramble your generated password more. Re-entry in case of mistake is allowed.
* Step 5. (Optional) Enter whether or not to generate more passwords.


Plans to expand (not yet available):
1. Based on user requirement, save the passwords in a text file with user-provided label.
