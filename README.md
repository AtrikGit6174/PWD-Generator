A personal Python project to generate passwords based on user constraints.

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/AtrikGit6174/PWD-Generator)
* Launched at: [https://atrikgit6174.github.io/PWD-Generator](https://atrikgit6174.github.io/PWD-Generator)
* [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AtrikGit6174/PWD-Generator/blob/main/PWD_Generator.ipynb)- Click here to use it! 
(Or scroll down and Open In Colab)

Feel free to edit the Google Colab blob, it opens in playground mode, so it doesn't affect the main code.

* Step 3. (Optional) Enter no. of constraints like number of capital letters, small letters, special chars or digits.
	* Checks are provided so that (no. of constrained chars <= total no. of chars). Re-entry in case of mistake is allowed.
	
Get your required random password.

* Step 4. (Optional) Enter whether or not to scramble your generated password more. Re-entry in case of mistake is allowed.
* Step 5. (Optional) Enter whether or not to generate more passwords.

A lot more testing conditions have been implemented to ease user engagement.
